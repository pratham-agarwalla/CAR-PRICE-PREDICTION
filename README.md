**About Numpy**

Numpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.




- **Pandas**

**About Pandas**

Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.

- **Sklearn**

**About Sklearn**

Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistent interface in Python. This library, which is largely written in Python, is built upon NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

**Different functions imported from Sklearn:-**

- **train\_test\_split-** Using [train_test_split()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) from the data science library [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), you can split your dataset into subsets that minimize the potential for bias in your evaluation and validation process.
- **svm-** Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers’ detection. It is used in applications like handwriting recognition, intrusion detection, face detection, email classification, gene classification, and in web pages.
- **accuracy\_score-** This function computes subset accuracy: the set of labels predicted for a sample must exactly match the corresponding set of labels in y\_true.




- **Seaborn**

**Importing Seaborn**

**About Seaborn**

Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. It helps you explore and understand your data. Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.

Model Analysis

-----
- With an accuracy score of 84.27% on training data and an accuracy of 87.09% on test data, our model will predict the price of the car.
